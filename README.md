Global Translator


This project was an overnight effort for the college hackathon.


THE IDEA:
The theme of the project and the hackathon was 'Visualization'.

WHAT IT DOES:
The app is a literal translation of the theme. It basically takes in a string(in English) as input, 
searches images for the words using Google Images API, concatinates them and presents the string in the form of combined images.

PURPOSE AND UTILITY:
The app merely extends the idea of the theme, taking the input(the sentence) to a higher level of abstraction
(images) and presenting them.
This app can serve as a global English(currently) translator bridging the gap between English speaking person 
and anyone who does not understand English. [Pictures are the language of the world]
